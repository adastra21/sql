# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.  
_Note: See `q2_erd.png`_

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?
_Note: See `q3_scd.png`_

```
Type 1 involves overwriting address column with the latest address.
Type 2 involves adding a new row for each address added by the customer.

Type 1 is more privacy-preserving since it only stores one address per customer. 
Type 2 stores the entire address history of customers, and could be used to track the 
movements of customers without their awareness or consent.

Both raise privacy concerns since address is a personally-identifiable information. 
Employees could use it to retaliate or stalk a customer, so access to customer_addresses 
table should be restricted.
```

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://imgur.com/a/u0m8fX6)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?
```
The AdventureWorks Schema is more extensive than my ERD. Here are two differences:

1. It uses different schemas for each object of the overall schema (e.g. Person). 
2. It also identifies column constraints such as primary key and foreign key.

I would consider adding column constraints to my ERD.
